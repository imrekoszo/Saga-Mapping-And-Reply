Demonstrating 2 things:

- NServiceBus Bus.SendLocal(), Bus.Reply() and Saga.ReplyToOriginator() don't need endpoint configurations to be present
	(they explicitly define the endpoint internally)
- It is possible to use a mixed saga finding configuration, i.e. some messages are associated with a saga based on the ConfigureHowToFindSaga() override, while others can implement ISagaMessage and use the default association based on their SagaId property
